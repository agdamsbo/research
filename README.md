# research-year

Hello world!
This is my first attempt at creating something usefull for openly sharing. In my work as a research year student through Aarhus University, Denmark at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, I've been introduced to working in the programming language R.
During this work I've come accross a few problems apparently unique for the work with data from the Danish medical databases. To analyse the data in R I've had to rewrite some commands and to write my own, so I thought that I should share them here for others to take advantage of. Nothing fancy, but hopefully you can skip af few steps on your way through data analysis.


For thet start I've uploaded three commands:
- age_calc_function.R
- cpr_check_function.R
- cpr_sex_function.R
- date_convert_function.R
- dob_extract_cpr_function.R
- hwe_fun.R
-- This is actually the function I am most proud of, as it represents an actual universal test.

All of these commands are written to work with the Danish Central Person Registry (CPR) numbers of the format ddmmyy-xxxx.
